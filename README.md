# Internet Affordability by Country

Access to Internet is a basic human right, the United Nations declared in 2016, however there are many countries that Internet is still not affordable. In Europe, 87% of families enjoy Internet access, while that figure is only 18% in Africa.

This project shows that there are countries that Internet access costs more than 20% of the average monthly income of a household.

## Why is Internet so important?
The Internet is so embedded in our lives that sometimes we don't realize that it links to our human rights, such as right to freedom of speech, right to development and right to freedom of assembly.

The global coronavirus pandemic has revealed how dependent we have become on Internet access. Voting, telemedicine, studying, shopping, among other things that we do without even realizing there are people that don't have Internet access.

## Where is data from?
